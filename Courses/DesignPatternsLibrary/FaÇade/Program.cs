/**
 * From wikipedia.
 * The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system 
 * has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities 
 * of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class 
 * which contains a set of members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client 
 * and hide the implementation details.
